Miniproject Assignment 9/8/2024

<b>Exercise 1:</b>
<br> max_bright: 5000 
<br> min_bright: 28000

<b>Exercise 2:</b>
<br>We played the National Anthem

<b>Exercise 3: </b>
We edited the exercise_game.py code to compute the response time (average, minimum, and maximum) for 10 LED flashes. Upon each press, the values will be calculated with respect toe each LED flash. This data is then stored in a .json format, which is then sent through the cloud to our firebase data. The trickest part of this was connecting the pi to the wifi since the pi would need internet connection in order for the information to be sent to the database.

User Story: The user would use this device to test their tactile reflexes over n number of reflex trials. In this case, the average, minimum, and maximum response times were stored in a easy to read json format. The user would be able to access the readable information in the cloud, and compare it to previous scores as all scores will be stored in the firebase.
